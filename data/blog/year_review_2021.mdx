Heyoo everyone, so I hope you know me, if not so go and check my profile :D 
Ok so I wanted to write a **YEAR** in **REVIEW**, just to review my work of 2021. So honestly I didn't have any idea on how to write a year in review
so I checked a few online resources to learn how to write the same. So this blog is going to be some experiment, comment if you want to give suggestions.

* Worked with a Proffessor named Gilad, we worked on project related to CMU, called Autolab but integrating it in our college and automate most of the stuff 
* Joined Atom EI as an Android Engineer Intern
* Got interested into Visual Learning and Recogniton, Robotic Vision, and ML Securites.
* Took 2 session, one on Android Development and other on Introduction to AI
* Won Best Hardware Digikey Category and Best Google Cloud category prize in MLH hackathon


### Lifestyle
* Started investmenting in stocks, learned some stuff related to Intraday trading, F/O, and market trends (a lot to learn tho)

## Lessons learned this year
So this year was really a good learing year for me, learned about stuff such as -

* **Startups** and other stuffs related to business such as what is Saas, business model of a startup, why not to just start things randomly, what is important to focus firs. For example one should focus first on validating his/her idea with the people around, whether it will
be a good idea to start or just a other common products existing. Also there are various others things which one will learn if you are focusing on startups such as how to get fundings, MVP, tech stack is secondary first is always your audience. There was
a good learning curve while exploring this, you can follow some good twitter accounts to learn more from their experience and teachings.


* Basics of **Deep Learning**, so it was the year where I learned how to get started with this peice of magic. It's just great to see how things like calculus, linear algebra in general Maths makes this whole system interesting. When I started, I focused on learning stuff such as normal DL concepts
and libraries like Tensorflow, keras, etc. But soon came to know about the maths part, why one should learn maths to dive more deeper. I still remember the chapters I read from Grokking DL expliaing the maths behind Neural Networks and other DL theory.
So I belive if you want to make career in Deep Learning related to research part, go and explore maths parallely. A few books I would suggest are like Maths for Machine Learning and Grokking DL for theory. Other than maths I also came to know the power of quality projects in Deep Learning. If you know theory, it is not enough you need to learn how to
implement them, and believe me it is going to help you to understang stuff from different perespective. You can replicate research papers (that's what I am doing) or may be start with a guality projct don't spend times on waste projects :P. So after going through all this I decided to dive more deeper into Robotic Vision and Visual recognition domain in AI/DL


* **Habits vs Goal**, ok so I came across this while reading a book The Atomic Habits, it mentioned about the term called process, goals, habits, outcomes, beliefs, etc etc in one word I loved this book (not completed tho), so this book is about the effects of tiny habits/changes to make some remarkable change in long run. In terms of maths integrate(calculus) tiny actions over a long time, you will understand the power of changes. It also discusses about the
the system to follow, like what to do and understanding the why part. I would advice everyone to read this book once.


* Importance of **Fitness**, ohk this is one of the thing I am proud of to start. During this lockdown and pandemic I was at my Home and gained around 15-16 Kgs of weights, and it made me feel quite lazy, unhealthy, inactive so decided to join Gym to focus on health. A lot of things happened in between such as during second wave covid gyms were closed, I got sick for a short period of time but it made me loose all my gained muscle. But still I maintained the diet, by diet I will say it 
is one of the healty dier I ever had. And by managing all this exercise and diet I lost aroud 17-18 kgs of weight. Finally then decided to restart my muscle gain routine. Soon got to know my college reopening news, so I need to leave my old gym and continue in college Gym, it's going to another headache let's see how I manage that.

* Importance of a *Reading habit**, as I mentioned the benifits of reading The Atomic Habits, so  similar to that read several other blogs, a few books, and other stuff. I personally having a consitent reading habits helps a lot to learn and grow. It will enrich your mind with thoughts that make remarkable changes on long run. It will help you to think from different perespective. Reading habits not just means reading some lifestyle related books, but it means reading stuff that matters, learning something new.
 
* Dealing with Failures - As you might looked into some of my achievements but behind all of them there were several failures. I believe getting failed is find, just learn from those move and make change in your mind (fix mistakes) and then you are ready to grow. Don't repeat the same mistake. Failure is just a redirection, take some time find the path and move on, fight again, learn again that will improve you.  

* **Importance of Guidance**, it is very important to have guidance, mentors, teacher in life. They will help you to reshape your thoughts, make more from less. They will correct in your mistakes, even they will tell your mistakes, rectify them learn from them.

* Managing teams and mentoring people

* Learning communication skills, it is really very important, if you know how to talk to people, how to make connections, you are ready to go. I personally experience the role of communication in exposure. Gave a few talks, took some sessions which helped a lot to learn more stuff related to this. 

* Traveled places to know more about me and people there, it was the best part I learned a lot while traveling, such as culture, tradition, foods, and much more. Night stargazing was one of the best part which I liked and the beauty of places was such an amazing thing I saw ever.
