### A day in orphanage 
It was one of the best experiences I had in the last few years. One of the seniors told me to bring cakes and cookies for them from an ashram bakery shop. The day started with the wonderful bus ride towards the orphanage. We played music and people started dancing on the bus in very little space. Bhanu Bhaiya and Manoj Bhaiya and other senior started teaching us some cool dance moves. After a journey of about 1 hour, we reached our destination.

All the kids started to come out of their hostel and they were waiting for us. We also brought a football to play with them, so then we went to play football with them. There were so many children so we somehow made two teams and started playing football. They were enjoying the game and playing with full attention but I and some of my friends are just watching the happiness of those children.

There was such a large number of children present in the ground we hardly remember who all are in our team, so whenever we got the ball, we just hit it to the opposite side without giving the pass to anyone. It was a really fun match as the entire ground was filled with children and the ball being kicked around we played for solid 30-45 mins. There was also a communication lag, as they don't know Hindi or English and I don't know Malayalam, so we are just contacting through broken English, and facial expressions.

Then we were called for snacks cakes, tea, some cookies it was such a tasty snack. Then we started to play the group game which was organized by Aswin Bhaiya and simultaneously the girls started to play dodge ball and some more games.  We had a small interaction kind of session with the kids. There was this one particular girl who was making fun of all of us. She told me I look like a joker. But she was really a good comedian. Then we had a small group dance with the children. We took a group photo with the children and departed towards the college.

As we all are bored with the mess food so we decided to eat in a restaurant Nalla Bhoomi. The food was really awesome and also there was a birthday celebration for one of our seniors. I am thankful to all the members of the club as they made it a really good experience and also thankful to the organizing committee as they managed everything perfectly.
